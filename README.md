# Langton's Ant
> CS-162 (Intro to CS II) Program

A simulation of Langton's Ant, written in C++  

## How the simulation works:
> Langton's Ant is a simulation involving an "ant" that makes a series of moves:  
> > - On a *white* cell, the ant turns 90 degrees *clockwise*, changes the cell to *black*, and moves forward 1 cell  
> > - On a *black* cell, the ant turns 90 degrees *counter-clockwise*, changes the cell to *white*, and moves forward 1 cell

## How to compile and run:
> 1. Copy/paste all the program code into a directory
> 2. In that directory, type the command: make to run the makefile
> 3. Type the command: `RunAnt` to run the program
> 4. Type `1` and press `Enter` to play
> 5. Follow the game set-up instructions, and begin
